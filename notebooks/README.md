Example layout of a BigClive-style circuit board


## A4-led-panel
This is an A4-size PCB with an array of LEDs created using KiCad's
"Create Array" feature.

## A3-led-panel
This is an initial attempt, but I accidentally made the board too big.
This would be extremely expensive to get made and it doesn't have enough LEDs
to look like a proper "super computer".
